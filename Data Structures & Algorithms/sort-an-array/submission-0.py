        understanding:

            the output should be a array sorted from least to greatest -> [1,1,1,1,2,3,9,10]

            the time complexity of the algorithm must be O(n log(n))

            approach:
                heapsort

                1. loop through the array & push each item to the heap
                2. pop from the heap and insert into an array
