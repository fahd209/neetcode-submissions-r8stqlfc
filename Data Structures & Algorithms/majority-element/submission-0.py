            understanding:
                given array of nums every array in every test case will
                have a element that appears in more then half of the array
                I'm supposed to find that element

            linear time and o(n) space
            approach
            use a hashmap to count the occurance of each element then check 
            the hashmap to see which element has an occurance thats > [n / 2]
